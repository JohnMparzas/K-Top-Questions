# K-Top-Questions
The data files I use for this task. Data comes from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+(KDD) and are demographic data from the USA of 1994 and 1995. The data are divided into two files which are sorted by instance field weight in descending order: the males_sorted file has all the corresponding entries in men (field sex = Male) and the file females_sorted has all the records that correspond to females (field sex = Female). A column has been added to each record at the beginning, which contains the id of the record (ie its order) in the original file before separation and classification. For example, 135085 in its first line males_sorted means that this line is in position 135085 in the original file census-income.data, while the values ​​that follow 135085 are the values ​​of the age fields, class of worker, etc. Unzip the files and then use them. 
  **The goal is to find the top-K pairs with the highest sum of instance fields weight, taking into account only couples of the same age. its implementation
HRJN algorithm**. They are excluded people who are married (the value of the marital status field starts with “Married”) and minors (the value of the age field is less than 18). The lines of files that corresponding to invalid individuals should be ignored. For example, the top-1 pair is (135085, 67141) with age 49 and sum of instance weight 18656.3 + 7129.24 = 25785.54
 **Part 1: Algorithm A top-k join
Part 2: Algorithm B top-k join**
